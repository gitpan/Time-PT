 2CN4sip - Time::PT.pm (PipTime) created by Pip@CPAN.org to define 
   simple objects for storing instants in time.
 Desc: PT describes a simple object which encapsulates 10 fields:
     Century, Year, Month, Day, hour, minute, second, frame, jink, zone
   where frame is normally 1/60th-of-a-second && jink is normally 
   1/60th-of-a-frame.  The objects describe a high-precision time-
   instant with fields in decending order of precision such that 
   alphabetic listings will (typically) show time ascension && field 
   arithmetic can be easily performed.  PT objects can
   be added to / subtracted from Time::Frame objects to yield 
   new specific PT instants.
     The common use of PT is for a simple `pt` utility to 
   en/decode dates && times using seven (7) bass64 characters.
     1st: '0A1B2C3'
     2nd: 'Yd:2003,j:A7_,M:a3I' or 'f:3aL9.eP' 
     if field name ends with d, value is read as decimal nstd of default b64.
     Third way is super verbose decimal strings:
       '15 years, 3 months, 7 weeks, 4 jinx' can use any (or none) sep but :
     4th is hash
     Total Jinx possible for PT: 1,680,238,080,000,000 (1.7 quatrillion)
           JnxPTEpoch -> `pt __nWO0000` -> Midnight Jan. 1 7039 BCE
              PTEpoch -> `pt  _nWO`     -> Midnight Jan. 1 1361  CE
   PT members:
     new inits either with pt-param, expanded, or empty

       epoch_(seconds|frames|jinx)() methods (optional frames/jinx as floats)
     ptepoch_(seconds|frames|jinx)() methods 
       (since ptEpoch (`pt _nWO` Midnight, Jan1,1361))
     settle fields with options (like return new Frame object with only 
       total secs of old)
     re-def frame as other than 60th-of-a-second
     re-def jink  as other than 60th-of-a-frame
       eg. def f && j limits as 31.6227766016838 (sqrt(1000)) for ms jinx
           or just def f as 1000 for exactly ms frames
     allow month/year modes to be set to avg or relative

  My bass64 encoding uses characters: 0-9 A-Z a-z . _  since I don't like
    having spaces or plusses in my time strings.  I need times to be easy to
    append to filenames for very precise, consice, time-stamp versioning.
  Each encoded character represents (normally) just a single date or time 
    field.  All fields are 0-based except Month && Day.  The fields are:
      Year-2000, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, Frame (60th-of-a-second)
  There are three (3) exceptions to the rule that each character only
    represents one date or time field.  The bits are there so... why not? =)
  0) Each 12 added to the Month adds  64 to the Year.
  1)      24 added to the Hour  adds 320 to the Year.
  2)      31 added to the Day   makes the year negative just before adding 
            2000.
  So with all this, any valid pt (of 7 b64 characters) represents a unique 
    instant (precise down to a Frame [60th-of-a-second]) that occurred or 
    will occur between the years 1361 && 2639 (eg. New Year's Day of each 
    of those years would be '_nWO' && '_n1O').  These rules break down as:
 Hour   Day  Month     Year    YearWith2000

 Notz:  
  PT + Frame can become the core of a new input language which accounts
    for time.  It could be game sequences like a fireball that can be rolled
    from d->df && df->f only at a certain speed ... but then also later
    maybe time-sensitive computer input like typematic key repeat rate but
    configurable... smarter?  The combinatorics on the X-Box Live pswd is
    8**4 == 4096 (butn: u,d,l,r,x,y,L,R) so even exhausting the search space
    (assuming you're too wise for a smpl likely 4-char sequence) could be
    finished manually in about 9 hours if you complete a test cycle each
    8 seconds.  Automated would need programmable circuit... plug that
    thang into USB && make an easy sequencer PT+Frame- based IF to perform!
    So cool!
  Could create an easy IF to setup any sort of practice scenario,
    programmable pad behavior, or even store replays as device inputs &&
    feed them back in... woohoo that's fscking cool!  GameOver specialty =)
    umm it would basically need the same IF as a fighting game tool hehe =).
  Don't need Math::BigInt to store pt epoch seconds (pte's) because perl's 
    floats already have enough precision to store them.  Use the fractional 
    part of those values to store 60ths && don't use builtin timelocal 
    functions which only accept 1970-2036 (or whatever limited) epoch 
    seconds (only 32-bit ints or something =( ).
  Interaction with other Time modules: 
    Time::Period  - just have an Epoch export option && Period can use it
    Time::Avail   - doesn't seem useful to my purposes
    Time::Piece   - might be nice to mimic this module's object interface
    Time::Seconds - handy for dealing with lots of seconds but about 60ths?
  old 5-char pt examples: (update these when there's time)
 Xmpl: `pt 01`        == localtime(975657600) # seconds since Epoch
     `pt 1L7Mu`       == unpack time (Sun Jan 21 07:22:56 2001)
     `pt _VNxx`       == localtime(1143878399)
     `pt pt`          == unpack current pt (akin to `pt `pt``)
     `pt e`           == localtime  (eg. Thu Jan 21 07:22:56 2001)
     `pt e e`         == current epoch seconds
     `pt 1L7Mu e`     == convert from pt to epoch (980090576)
     `pt 975657600 E` == convert from Epoch seconds to pt (01)
     `pt Jan 21, 2001 07:22:56`    -> 1L7Mu
     `pt Sun Jan 21 07:22:56 2001` -> 1L7Mu
     `pt 1L7Mu cmp FEET0`          -> lt 
     `pt FEET0 cmp 1L7Mu`          -> gt 
     `pt 2B cmp 2B`                -> eq

NAME

Time::PT - objects to store an instant in time

VERSION

This documentation refers to version 1.0.3CQ8ibf of 
Time::PT, which was released on Fri Dec 26 08:44:37:41 2003.

SYNOPSIS

  use Time::PT;
  
  my $f = Time::PT->new();

  print "PipTime is: $f\n";
  print 'The Day-of-Week today is: ', $f->dow(), "\n";

DESCRIPTION

This module has been adapted from the Time::Piece module 
written by Matt Sergeant <matt@sergeant.org> && Jarkko 
Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi>.  Time::PT inherits base 
data structure && object methods from Time::Fields.  
PT was written to simplify storage && calculation 
of encoded, yet distinct && human-readable, time data 
objects.

This module (Time::PT) does not replace the standard localtime &&
gmtime functions like Time::Piece but Time::PT objects behave
almost identically to Time::Piece objects otherwise (since it
was adapted from... I said that already =) ).

2DO

- mk interoperable w/ Time::Seconds objects

- add Time::Zone stuff to use && match zone field reasonably

- flesh out constructor init data parsing && formats supported

- consider epoch functions like _epoch([which epoch]) or individuals
          like _jinx_epoch()

- mk PT->new able to create from different 'epoch' init types

- fix weird 0 month && 0 day problems

- replace legacy pt() with new() wrapper

-     What else does PT need?

WHY?

The reason I created PT was that I have grown so enamored with
Bass64 representations of everything around me that I was 
compelled to write a simple clock utility ( `pt` ) using Bass64.
This demonstrated the benefit to be gained from time objects with
distinct fields && configurable precision.  Thus, Time::Fields
was written to be the abstract base class for:

  Time::Frame  ( creates objects which represent spans    of time )
      && 
  Time::PT     ( creates objects which represent instants in time )

USAGE

Many of Time::PT's methods have been patterned after the excellent
Time::Piece module written by Matt Sergeant <matt@sergeant.org>
&& Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi>.

new(<InitType>, <InitData>)

Time::PT's constructor can be called
as a class method to create a brand new object or as an object 
method to copy an existing object.  Beyond that, new() can 
initialize PT objects 3 different ways:

 -1) <packedB64InitStringImplies'str'>
    eg. Time::PT->new('3C79jo0');
  0) 'str'  => <packedB64InitString>
    eg. Time::PT->new('str'  => '0A1B2C3D4E');
  1) 'list' => <arrayRef>
    eg. Time::PT->new('list' => [0, 1, 2..9]);
  2) 'hash' => <hashRef>
    eg. Time::PT->new('hash' => {'jink' => 8, 'year' => 2003})

color(<DestinationColorTypeFormat>)

This is an object member
which will join bass64 representations of each field that has
been specified in use() && joins them with color-codes or color
escape sequences with formats for varied uses.  Currently
available DestinationColorTypeFormats are:

  'ANSI'  # eg. \e[1;32m
  'zsh'   # eg. %{\e[1;33m%}
  'HTML'  # eg. <a href="http://Ax9.org/pt?"><font color="#FF1B2B">
  'Simp'  # eg. RbobYbGbCbUbPb

The following methods allow access to individual fields of 
Time::PT objects:

  $t->C  or  $t->century
  $t->Y  or  $t->year
  $t->M  or  $t->month
  $t->D  or  $t->day
  $t->h  or  $t->hour
  $t->m  or  $t->minute
  $t->s  or  $t->second
  $t->f  or  $t->frame
  $t->j  or  $t->jink
  $t->z  or  $t->zone

Any combination of above single letters can be used as well.  
Following are some common useful examples:

  $t->hms                 # returns list of fields eg. [12, 34, 56]
  $t->hms(12, 56, 34)     # sets fields: h = 12, m = 56, s = 34
  $t->hmsf                # [12, 34, 56, 12]
  $t->hmsfj               # [12, 34, 56, 12, 34]
  $t->hmsfjz              # [12, 34, 56, 12, 34, 16]
  $t->time                # same as $t->hms
  $t->alltime             # same as $t->hmsfjz
  $t->YMD                 # [2000,  2,   29]
  $t->MDY                 # [   2, 29, 2000]
  $t->DMY                 # [  29,  2, 2000]
  $t->CYMD                # [  20,  0,    2, 29]
  $t->date                # same as $t->YMD
  $t->alldate             # same as $t->CYMD
  $t->CYMDhmsfjz          # [  20,  0,    2, 29, 12, 13, 56, 12, 13, 16]
  $t->pt7                 # same as $t->YMDhmsf
  $t->all                 # same as $t->CYMDhmsfjz
  $t->dt                  # same as $t->CYMDhmsfjz
  "$t"                    # same as $t->CYMDhmsfjz except only prints
                          #   fields which are "used" which by default
                          #   is the same as the $t->YMDhmsf of pt7()

Method names can be in any case with the following exceptions.  
Special handling exists to resolve ambiguity between the Month && 
minute fields.  If a lowercase 'm' is used adjacent to a 'y' or 'd'
of either case, it is interpreted as Month.  Otherwise, the case of 
the 'm' distinguishes Month from minute.  An uppercase 'M' is ALWAYS
Month.  An adjacent uppercase 'H' or 'S' will not turn an uppercase
'M' into minute.  Method names which need to specify Month or minute
fields can also optionally specify the distinguishing vowel 
('o' or 'i') instead of 'M' or 'm'.

  $t->ymd                 # same as $t->YMD
  $t->dmy                 # same as $t->DMY
  $t->MmMm                # Month minute Month minute
  $t->HMS                 # hour Month second! NOT same as $t->hms 
  $t->yod                 # same as $t->YMD
  $t->chmod               # Century hour minute Month Day
  $t->FooIsMyJoy          # frame Month Month minute second Month Year
                          #   jink Month Year

After importing this module, when you use localtime or gmtime in a
scalar context, you DO NOT get a special Time::PT object like you
would when using Time::Piece.  This module relies on a new() 
constructor instead.  The following methods are available on 
Time::PT objects though && remain as similar to Time::Piece
functionality as makes sense.

  $t->frm                 # also as $t->frame && $t->subsecond
  $t->sec                 # also available as $t->second
  $t->min                 # also available as $t->minute
  $t->hour                # 24 hour
  $t->mday                # also available as $t->day_of_month
  $t->mon                 # 1 = January
  $t->_mon                # 0 = January
  $t->monname             # Feb
  $t->month               # same as $t->mon
                 # *NOTE* The above definition ( of $t->month() ) is 
                 # different from the Time::Piece interface which defines
                 # month() the same as monname() instead of mon().
  $t->fullmonth           # February
  $t->year                # based at 0 (year 0 AD is, of course 1 BC)
  $t->_year               # year minus 1900
  $t->yy                  # 2 digit year
  $t->wday                # 1 = Sunday
  $t->_wday               # 0 = Sunday
  $t->day_of_week         # 0 = Sunday
  $t->wdayname            # Tue
  $t->day                 # same as mday
                 # *NOTE* Similar to month(), I've defined day() 
                 # differently from Time::Piece which makes it the same
                 # as wdayname() instead of mday().
  $t->fullday             # Tuesday
  $t->yday                # also available as $t->day_of_year, 0 = Jan 01
  $t->isdst               # also available as $t->daylight_savings

The following functions return a list of the named fields.  The
return value can be joined with any desirable delimiter like:

  join(':', $t->hms);
  join($t->time_separator, $t->hms);

but the functions also can take a list of parameters to update
the corresponding named fields like:

  $t->YMD( 2003, 12, 8 ) # assigns new date of December 8th, 2003 to $t

Following are some useful functions && comments of sample return values:

  $t->hms                 # [12, 34, 56]
  $t->hmsf                # [12, 34, 56, 12]
  $t->time                # same as $t->hmsf

  $t->ymd                 # [2000,  2, 29]
  $t->date                # same as $t->ymd
  $t->mdy                 # [ 2, 29, 2000]
  $t->dmy                 # [29,  2, 2000]
  $t->datetime            # 2000-02-29T12:34:56            (ISO 8601)
  $t->expand              # Tue Feb 29 12:34:56:12 2000
  $t->cdate               # same as $t->expand
  $t->compress            # 02TCYuC
  "$t"                    # same as $t->compress

  $t->is_leap_year        # true if it is
  $t->month_last_day      # 28-31

  $t->time_separator($s)  # set the default separator (default ":")
  $t->date_separator($s)  # set the default separator (default "-")
  $t->day_list(@days)     # set the default weekdays
  $t->mon_list(@days)     # set the default months

Local Locales

Both wdayname() && monname() can accept the same list parameter 
as day_list() && mon_list() respectively for temporary help with
simple localization.

  my @days = ( 'Yom Rishone', 'Yom Shayni', 'Yom Shlishi', 'Yom Revi\'i', 
               'Yom Khahmishi', 'Yom Hashishi', 'Shabbat' );

  my $hebrew_day = pt->wdayname(@days);
                 # pt->monname() can be used similarly

To update the global lists, use:

  Time::PT::day_list(@days);
    &&
  Time::PT::mon_list(@months);

Calculations

PT object strings (both in normal initialization && printing) grow
left-to-right starting from the Year to specify whatever precision
you need while Frame objects grow right-to-left from the frame field.

It's possible to use simple addition and subtraction of objects:

  use Time::Frame;
  
  my $cur_pt       = Time::PT->new();# Dhmsf
  my $one_week     = Time::Frame->new('70000');
  my $one_week_ago = $cur_pt - $one_week;

If a calculation is done with a raw string parameter instead of an
instantiated object, the most likely appropriate object 
constructor is called on it.  These init strings must adhere to
the implied 'str' format for auto-creating objects;  I aim to
support a much wider array of operations && to interoperate with 
Time::Piece && Time::Seconds someday but not yet.

  my $cur_pt             = Time::PT->new();# Dhmsf
  my $half_hour_from_now = $cur_pt + 'U00';

The following are valid (where $t0 and $t1 are Time::PT objects
&& $f is a Time::Frame object):

  $t0 - $t1;  # returns Time::Frame object
  $t0 - '63'; # returns Time::PT object
  $t0 + $f;   # returns Time::PT object

Comparisons

All normal numerical && string comparisons should work reasonably on
Time::PT objects: 

  "<",  ">",  "<=", ">=", "<=>", "==" &&  "!="
  "lt", "gt", "le", "ge", "cmp", "eq" and "ne"

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss

The ISO 8601 standard defines the date format to be YYYY-MM-DD, and
the time format to be hh:mm:ss (24 hour clock), and if combined,
they should be concatenated with date first and with a capital 'T'
in front of the time.

Week Number

The ISO 8601 standard specifies that weeks begin on Monday and the first
week of the year is the one that includes both January 4th and the
first Thursday of the year.  In other words, if the first Monday of
January is the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding days are part of the 
final week of the prior year.  Week numbers range from 1 to 53.

NOTES

Whenever individual Time::PT attributes are going to be 
printed or an entire object can be printed with multi-colors,
the following mapping should be employed whenever possible:

           D      Century -> DarkRed
           A      Year    -> Red
           T      Month   -> Orange
           E      Day     -> Yellow
                   hour   -> Green
            t      minute -> Cyan
            i      second -> Blue
            m      frame  -> Purple

Please see the color() member function in the USAGE section.

There's some weird behavior for PipTimes created with a zero month
or day field since both are 1-based.  I aim to fix all these bugs
but be warned that this issue may be causing math errors for a bit.

I hope you find Time::PT useful.  Please feel free to e-mail
me any suggestions || coding tips || notes of appreciation 
("app-ree-see-ay-shun").  Thank you.  TTFN.
